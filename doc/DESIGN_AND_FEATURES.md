# Design and Features of the Polkadot API Server

This page will present the inner workings of the API Server as well as the features that one is able to interact with and how. The following points will be presented and discussed:

- [**Design**](#design)
- [**Complete List of Endpoints**](#complete-list-of-endpoints)
- [**Using the API**](#using-the-api)

## Design

The components involved in the API Server are the following:
- The **Polkadot Nodes** from which the API retrieves information
- This **API Server** which uses the `@polkadot/api` JavaScript package to retrieve data from the Polkadot Nodes
- The **User/Program** which sends `GET Requests` to the `API Server` as per the defined Endpoints, and receives JSON formatted responses from the `API Server`

The diagram below gives an idea of the various components at play when the API Server is running, and how they interact with each other and the user/program:

The API Server works as follows:
- The API Server connects to each of these nodes one by one, as specified in the `config/user_config_nodes.ini` file.
- The API connections to each node exist within JS as `promise` objects.
- The API Server opens a port, as specified in the `config/user_config_main.ini` file.
- By communicating through this port, the API Server receives the endpoints specified in the `Complete List of Endpoints` section below, and requests information from the nodes it is connected to accordingly.
- Once the requested information is received from the node, it is formatted as a JSON, and returned.

## Using the API
For example, the endpoint `/api/rpc/system/health` can be called as follows: `http://localhost:3000/api/rpc/system/health?websocket=ws://1.2.3.4:9944`.
If successful, this will return:
```json
{
    "result": {
        "peers": 92,
        "isSyncing": false,
        "shouldHavePeers": true
    }
}
```
If an API connection for the node specified in the `websocket` field is not set up, this will return:
```json
{
    "error": "An API for ws://1.2.3.4:9944 needs to be setup before it can be queried"
}
```
If an API call without all the required fields is sent, such as `http://localhost:3000/api/query/imOnline/authoredBlocks?websocket=ws://1.2.3.4:9944&session_index=3`, this will return:
```json
{
    "error": "You did not enter the stash account address of the validator that needs to be queried"
}
```
